# Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-2019-Project-One

The main objective of this project is to apply the patterns and techniques presented during the lectures, and to create a simple multi-tiered application in Java EE.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need these programs installed on your system:

- docker
- IDE as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) (for development)

Install docker for [Windows 10](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-windows-10), [MAC](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-macos) or [Linux](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
