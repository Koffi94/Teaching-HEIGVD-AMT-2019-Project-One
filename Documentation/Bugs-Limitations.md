## Known bugs

- Each user can add, edit or delete a film or a cinema. Because of the time, we suppose that users are honest people and don't edit or delete entries for bad reasons.

- Sometimes users get redirected to the login page after a successfull login. Clearing the browser cache solves this issue.

- You can format the URL the get an inexisting page of the screenings table.

## Limitations

- Amount of simultaneous user sessions are limited by the RAM available for the Payara docker.
